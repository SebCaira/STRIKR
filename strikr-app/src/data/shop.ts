// genuinely new lead: the app never implemented Google's required EEA
// consent flow (UMP) before requesting ads, and our tester is in France
// — see src/lib/ads.ts for the reasoning and the fix (now wired into
// ensureAdsInitialized()). Unlike the previous two attempts (RN patch,
// library downgrade — both ruled out, crash reproduced identically
// either way), this is a different mechanism entirely, not yet tested.
// If a real ad still crashes on a fresh build, set this back to false
// and report back — don't ship a production/App Store build with this
// on until it's survived a real on-device test.
