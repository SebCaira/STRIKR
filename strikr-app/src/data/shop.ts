// library's iOS event-emitting bridge for Full Screen Ads, which
// react-native-google-mobile-ads only moved onto the (crash-prone, per
// facebook/react-native#54859) New Architecture TurboModule path in
// v14.5.0 (see package.json — pinned to 14.4.3, the last version before
// that migration, so rewarded/interstitial ads use the older, unaffected
// bridge instead). See src/lib/ads.ts for the full chain of reasoning.
// If a real ad still crashes on a fresh build, set this back to false and
// report back — don't ship a production/App Store build with this on
// until it's survived a real on-device test.
